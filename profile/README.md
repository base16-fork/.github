# Base16-Fork

> A more structured base16 theme environment

## Why does this fork exist?

### Reduce fragmentation

The original base16 structure is too scattered and hard to keep track off. This
fork organizes all the scheme and template config files into two separate
repos. The extra benefit is base16 builders would be slightly faster at
cloning the sources.

### Aim to be more active

The maintainers of the orginal base16 repositories are unactive lately. Thus,
it's difficult to get pull requests accepted. This fork aims to remedy this.

### Regenerative build

The `base16-fork` repository refreshes and generates themes weekly. This is to
make the themes more accessible by eliminating the need to clone multiple
templates to get all available themes or use a base16 builder.

The two repositories, `base16-templates-recipe` and `base16-schemes-recipe`,
are also synced with the original sources weekly, so all the updates from the
original sources are also included in this fork.
